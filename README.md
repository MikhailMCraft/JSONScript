# JSONScript
Write in your favorite ~~data format~~ programming language now, with JSONScript!

# Usage
Clone the repo to any folder. Build the program, which will generate a `compilerSettings.json` file inside the specified directory, as well as some example files.

JSON files containing code are added to this directory to be read by the program. You **MUST** suffix each file with either `Class`, `Method`, or `Namespace`, otherwise they will be **IGNORED!!**
